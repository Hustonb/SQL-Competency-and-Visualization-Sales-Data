### Project Description and Motivation:
This project showcases my proficiency in SQL for database design and exploratory data analysis, as well as my data visualization skills using Tableau. 
The premise of this project is that a blogger’s online store has reached out to me to take care of their data modeling needs. The website isn’t up and running yet, but the user has a list of fields and tables that they will need included in the data model. The user is also requesting that an interactive dashboard is made showing key metrics for her business. The inspiration for this project is my girlfriend’s blog, which she’s in the process of getting up and running. Note somewhere that this project is hypothetical and no actual customer requested it (in different words), though I did consult my girlfriend to see which tables and fields she would need.

### Chronological Project Process:
Customer provided database requirements (required fields for different tables and products which her shop will be selling), and questions to be answered in the visualization.
Designed database schema to fit customer needs: (https://github.com/Hustonb/SQL-Competency-and-Visualization-Sales-Data/blob/main/SalesDBSchema.png ) 
Generated sample data using AI tools to populate the Orders, Customers, and Storage tables (Products were provided by customer).
Created SQL database in MySQL, and inserted records: https://github.com/Hustonb/SQL-Competency-and-Visualization-Sales-Data/blob/main/PopulateTables.sql 
Performed EDA in SQL to demonstrate SQL proficiency and gain insight into customer questions: https://github.com/Hustonb/SQL-Competency-and-Visualization-Sales-Data/blob/main/AllEDA.sql 
Created tableau dashboard to visualize KPIs and trends for customer: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benedict.robert.huston1540/viz/SalesDashboard_17137287157470/Orders?publish=yes
