### Project Description and Motivation:
This project showcases my proficiency in SQL for database design and exploratory data analysis, as well as my data visualization skills in Tableau. 
The premise of this project is that a blogger’s online store has reached out to me to take care of their data modeling and visualization needs. The website isn’t up and running yet, but the user has a list of fields and tables that they will need included in the data model. The user is also requesting that an interactive dashboard is made showing key metrics for her business. The inspiration for this project is my girlfriend’s blog, which she’s in the process of launching.

### Project Process:
1. Customer provided database requirements (fields for different tables and a list of products which her shop will be selling) and questions to be addressed in the visualization.
2. Designed database schema to fit customer needs: [SalesDBSchema.png](https://github.com/Hustonb/SQL-Competency-and-Visualization-Sales-Data/blob/main/SalesDBSchema.png ) 
3. Generated sample data using AI tools to populate the Orders, Customers, and Storage tables (Product table records were provided by customer).
4. Created SQL database in MySQL, and inserted records: [PopulateTables.sql](https://github.com/Hustonb/SQL-Competency-and-Visualization-Sales-Data/blob/main/PopulateTables.sql)
5. Performed EDA in SQL to demonstrate SQL proficiency and gain insight into customer's questions: [AllEDA.sql](https://github.com/Hustonb/SQL-Competency-and-Visualization-Sales-Data/blob/main/AllEDA.sql)
6. Created Tableau dashboard to visualize KPIs and trends: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/benedict.robert.huston1540/viz/SalesDashboard_17137287157470/Orders?publish=yes

### Installing and Executing Scripts:
To run the SQL scripts for yourself, download the two scripts in this repository. First, run PopulateTables.sql in order to create the tables and fill them with data. Then, run the different queries in the ALLEDA.sql script to gain insight into the data.
